# Contributing guide

Thank for your interest in contributing with this project.

This project is small and the rules are simple.

## Opening issues

You can open issues to report bugs, suggest new features, discuss changes or just share your opinion about the project.

### Tips when reporting bugs

Please take a look at three simple steps that help create good bug reports and enable a quick fix.

#### 1) Conditions to reproduce

When reporting bugs please state the current condition of your setup that you think might be related to the issue.

Some examples:

- Node and npm versions
- React version
- Usage of external libs or plugins (Immutable, debug, etc) and its versions

#### 2) What is wrong?

Report what isn't working properly. Explain it the most detailed way possible.

Things that help:

- Code snippets
- Tell the steps that lead to bug reproduction
- Screenshots

#### 3) How can we fix it? (optional)

This is optional but you can suggest a possible fix or propose a PR submission.

Before submiting a PR read this.

## Working in the project

You'll need to be familiar with CLI tools, [JS](https://www.javascript.com/), [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/), [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) packaging.

To build the project locally follow the 6 steps:

1. Fork and clone this repo to your local workspace.
2. Run `npm install`
3. Make your changes
4. Run `npm run build`
5. Commit
6. [Submit a PR](#pr)

That's it, you don't need to install anything else manually. npm will take care of everything for you.

### Contributing with source code

Changing source code is pretty straight forward.

Look for the `src` folder, there's where all the source code is.

Try to stick to the [airbnb styleguide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) when coding, [eslint](http://eslint.org/) is configured to check for that.

If you need to check manually, run `npm run lint`.

When adding new features please also add tests following the pattern located at the `__tests__` folder and change the inline documentation to properly reflect your changes.

After any change we suggest you run `npm run build` to see if everything is OK. It will lint, test and output the final code to the `lib` folder.

#### Tips to speed up development

- Use an editor or IDE compatible with [eslint](http://eslint.org/) so you have realtime code linting.
- Keep the tests running while you code, you can run `npm run watch-test` to do just that.

### Contributing with docs

As you can see from the source code, the docs are inline and generated by a tool called `esdoc`.

By running `npm run docs` you'll generate the HTML docs outputting to the `docs` folder.

Please run the command to update docs before sending a PR.

### Contributing with tests

Tests are located in the `__tests__` folder and follow the BDD pattern.

When you are done run tests with `npm test`.

We try to maintain 100% test coverage, but coverage does not guarantee test quality. Any improvement is welcome.

## <a href="#" id="pr"></a>Sending PRs

Pull requests are cool, you are welcome to submit them.

Please submit your PRs to master branch. Currently we see no reason to create feature branches in this small project.
